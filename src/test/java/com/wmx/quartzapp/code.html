<p>
    Instructs the <code>{@link Scheduler}</code> that upon a mis-fire
    situation, the <code>{@link SimpleTrigger}</code> wants to be
    re-scheduled to 'now' (even if the associated <code>{@link Calendar}</code>
    excludes 'now') with the repeat count left as-is.  This does obey the
    <code>Trigger</code> end-time however, so if 'now' is after the
    end-time the <code>Trigger</code> will not fire again.
</p>

<p>
    <i>NOTE:</i> Use of this instruction causes the trigger to 'forget'
    the start-time and repeat-count that it was originally setup with (this
    is only an issue if you for some reason wanted to be able to tell what
    the original values were at some later time).
